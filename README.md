# BlueBerryHarvest
andorid app for recording blueberry harvest

source code is in app/src/main/java/com/example/blueberryharvest
So far it is a work in progress, I am building this for my father who is an farmer and has blueberries. This is just the front end for now.
We are trying to decide the best way to store the data. We need a way to back up the data regularly in the field without having to rely
on a internet connection.
